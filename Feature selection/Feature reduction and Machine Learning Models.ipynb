Different ways of decreasing the number of features have been implemented so far: Lasso, RandomForest, PCA and based on the variance of each feature. None of these lead to satisfying results. Feel free to look at the notebook but keep that in mind. Alternatives solutions have to be investigated and papers read. \n",

    "    a. **IC50:** describes the concentration of an inhibitor that results in a half-maximal inhibition of a response (i.e. the concentration that reduces a response to 50% of its maximum). That maximum response being inhibited is due to the action of something else (typically an agonist for the receptor of interest). Maximum IC50 = 8. Minimum IC50 = 0. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    IC50 is obtained by plotting a measure of the cell death rate vs the concentration of the drug. IC50 is expressed as a concentration so the higher the concentration of drug needed to kill the cell line the more resistant that cell line is. If the IC50 is very low then the concentration (or amount) of drug needed to kill the cell line is also very low which means the cell line is more sensitive. Typically you get a S curve or sigmoidal curve. IC50 is the middle point of the sigmoidal curve. The threshold for calling a drug sensitive/resistant changes depending upon the IC50 value and we need to see how the sigmoidal curve behaves.\n",

Raw data were merged with assay metadata, and percent-viability scores were calculated relative to DMSO controls, after which concentration-response curves were fit for percent viability. The areas under percent-viability curves were computed and used as the measure of sensitivity*\". In one paper, the limit was set to **0.8 SD**. Sensitive cell lines were the ones with an activity area at least 0.8 SD above the mean. Resistant cell lines had an activity area at least 0.8 SD below the mean. All other samples were discared.\n",
