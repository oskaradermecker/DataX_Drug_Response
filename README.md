# DataX_Drug_Response

Welcome on the github of the project! The aim is to predict the drug response of cell population to candidate drugs based on their genetic alterations. We will be using two public datasets: GDSC (for the drug response) and CCLE (for the cell's genomes).

To navigate the Github, click on "master" and select the person's branch you would like to see. You should be able to download any file from there. Also, feel free to create your own branch and upload your code there. We'll be able to put everything in common from there. 

If you are not familiar with github, how to upload your files and would like to learn more, you can do so here: https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. There are plenty of resources online so feel free to look on other websites too.
